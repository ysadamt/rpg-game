**Built with:** C++, wxWidgets

Around one month into learning C++, I first built a this RPG game without a GUI from a [learncpp.com](https://learncpp.com) quiz question. To take things a step further, I  wanted to experiment with GUIs. I discovered and familiarized myself with the wxWidgets library and built a simple GUI that incorporated my code from the aforementioned quiz program.
